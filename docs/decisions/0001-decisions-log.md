# Decisions Log

## Context
This is a reference project with best practices and approaches to Software Development. One of the best practices is to have project documentation and to track project decisions. 

## Descision
The decisions will be logged in this repo. This log will be called `Decisions Logs` as the words Architectural and System look excessive to me.

A few starting rules:
  - Try to keep the decision record minimal and might iterate on it. 
  - Decision can be refined and edited because it'll be kept in git and have the story of changes.
