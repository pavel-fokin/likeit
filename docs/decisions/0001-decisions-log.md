# Decisions Log

### Date: 2024-02-07

## Context

This is a reference project with the practices and approaches to Software
Development. One of the practices is to track project decisions in a traceable
way. In a real project, the lack of such a process can lead to potential
misunderstandings, longer onboarding time, and challenges in maintaining a
common view of the system.

## Descision

The decisions will be logged in this repo. This log will be called _Decisions
Logs_ as the words Architectural and System look excessive to me.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Transparency**: Decisions log will provide a record of the rationale behind
  decisions, making it easier for team members to understand the thoughts behind
  choices.
- **Knowledge Base**: Decisions log will serve for onboarding new team members
  and providing a knowledge base, ensuring that everyone is on the same page
  regarding the project.
- **Communication**: Decisions log will support collaboration among team members
  by providing a centralized repository for technical and process decisions that
  can be easily referenced. Also, Decisions log helps to develop writing vs.
  verbal communication.

### Challenges

- **Team Engagement**: If there is no clear understanding of the value of this
  practice, the team members may ignore this documentation.
- **Lack of Value**: Without a clear and documented process for creating and
  reviewing decision records, this documentation may become unmaintainable.
- **Documentation Overhead**: The process of creating and maintaining the
  Decisions Log can introduce additional overhead, especially with the
  fast-changing requirements and environment.
- **Outdated Records**: Outdated or incomplete Decisions Log can mislead team
  members and create confusion about the current state of the system.
